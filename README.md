This mini project helps to understand some intermediate core React concepts like:

- Avoid props drilling by using children composition or context API.
- Lifting Up functions to handle logic in parent components.
- useMemo to avoid re-rendering expensive calculations like sorting. 
- localStorage to persist data when closing the tab or the browser window.
- Arrow function inside useState to initialize the state only when component is first rendered. When performing computation to determine the initial state or initializing from local storage.
- Updating array of objects state.
- Zustand instead of Context API to avoid components re-rendering due to lack of selectors.
